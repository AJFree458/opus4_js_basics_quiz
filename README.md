# opus4_js_basics_quiz

## Description 

Multiple choice quizzes can be useful for testing knowledge of a topic. This project's purpose is to create a timed quiz that will test a quiz takers knowledge of coding. This quiz will use multiple-choice questions, where each wrong answer will reduce the countdown time by a set amount and a correct answer will add more time to the countdown. It also will allow the quiz taker to save their score and initials at the end of the quiz.

This project is made with an eye to have a clean user interface that is responsive and adjusts to multiple screen types and sizes. It runs in the browser and has HTML and CSS that updates dynamically powered by Javascript.
